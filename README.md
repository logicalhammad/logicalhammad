## 🧠 Who is Logical Hammad?

I'm **Hammad Mustafa**, better known as **Logical Hammad** — a passionate software engineer and co-founder of [Nelston Technologies (Pvt) Ltd](https://nelston.com). I'm a Software Engineer from **CUST (Capital University of Science and Technology)** with a strong focus on creative problem solving, logical thinking, and building practical tech that actually helps people.

From developing smart water tank systems and facial recognition apps, to winning programming competitions and hackathons — I'm driven by logic, creativity, and the belief that anything is possible when passion meets purpose.

I believe in building software that’s not just functional — but meaningful.
